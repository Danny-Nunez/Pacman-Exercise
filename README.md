## Description
When the Add Pacman button is pressed a Pacmen is added to the array of Pacman, which keeps track of the position and velocity of each Pacman. The Pacmen bounce of the walls changing direction. Also the mouth opens en closes. 

## How to run
There are no dependencies. This should run inside the browser without the need for a proxy server

## Roadmap of future improvements
Candies could be randomly placed on the map for Pacman to eat.

## License Info
Code written by Danny Nunez using starter code from the MITxPRO full stack development bootcamp course.
